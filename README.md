# â˜• SQL Coffee Project

This is a beginner-level SQL project where I worked with a fictional coffee shop dataset to practice:

- Table creation
- Data insertion
- Filtering queries
- Aggregation and group operations

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- `coffee_project.sql` â€“ Contains all queries (CREATE, INSERT, SELECT)
- `screenshots/` â€“ Images of query outputs as proof of execution

## ðŸ“Œ Tools Used

- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- Snipping Tool (for screenshots)
- GitHub (for version control and project sharing)
